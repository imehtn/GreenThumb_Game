Learn about the world around you!
Whether you want to de-stress, have an interest in gardening, or are looking for something new, Green Thumb is here for you!

In Green Thumb, you play as a resident of an apartment complex that has decided to start a rooftop community garden, and you were chosen to oversee the garden for the first week! During the game, you will find a relaxing ambience in which you can plant and care for different Columbus-native plants.

The game consists of  taking care of different plants until their prime growth, selling them to obtain more seeds and grow other, more valuable plants. The ultimate goal is to have a full, thriving garden by the end of the in-game month (2 real-life minutes). Are you up for the challenge?
